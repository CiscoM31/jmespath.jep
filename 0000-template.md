## Abstract
[abstract]: #abstract

A brief description of what's being proposed.  Keep this section to a
single paragraph.

## Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

In this section, describe why this change is needed.  Is this enabling
queries that aren't possible with the current specification?  Is this change
proposing improved ergonomics for common queries?  Why does this feature
need to be part of JMESPath?  Use this section to make a compelling case why
JMESPath needs this feature.

JEPs that do not have sufficient motivation or interest will not be
able to be accepted.

## Specification
[specification]: #specification

This section describes the details of your change.  Write this section as if
you were updating the JMESPath specification.  When a JEP is accepted, parts of
this "Specification" section are often copied verbatim into the actual
JMESPath specification.  This section should include:

* Updated grammar rules if the syntax of the language is being modified.
* Details of any changes to how an expression is evaluated.

## Rationale
[rationale]: #rationale

This section provides a rationale for the proposed design.  Why was this
specific design chosen? This section often includes:

* Alternatives considered and why they were rejected.
* Any tradeoffs considered as part of this design.
* Rationale for the current scope, and why a larger (or smaller)
  scope was not chosen.
* Anticipated questions (and answers) that people may have when reading this
  JEP.

Keep in mind that this section is the rationale for the design of this
feature (the how), and the "Motivation" section describes *why* this
feature is needed.

## Testcases
[testcases]: #testcases

Add test cases that use the test schema in the
[jmespath.test](https://github.com/jmespath/jmespath.test)
repo.  If the JEP is accepted, these test cases will be copied over to the
jmespath.test repo.  You can provide the testcases in YAML instead of JSON
if you prefer.
